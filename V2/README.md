## Welcome to the TempTracker class

### Setup:

The following script is developed using JavaScript.

1. Navigate into the project folder
2. Double click the `index.html` file and the browser is openend.
3. Enter the temperature into the input field and click on the `Add temperature` button. (Whole numbers only)
4. This version assumes that there are some preset temperatures stored in the class TempTracker.
5. The UI will be updated with the new values calculated.

### Future improvements:

1. Improved code splitting: The current code is too less and straightforward to export to another class.
2. Accept floating temperature: Currently the app accepts only whole numbers.
